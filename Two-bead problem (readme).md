This programme computes the time trajectory of 2 point masses attached at the ends of a massless rod constrained by a horizontal 'floor' and acted upon by 
gravity.
The program stops when the bead initially at right touches the floor. Here, the intial condition that 'an impulse is given at the right end of the rod lying on the floor' is given.
