This programme computes the time trajectory of 2 point masses attached at the ends of a massless rod constrained by a horizontal 'floor' and acted upon by 
gravity. The given initial condition is when the system is laid on the floor and one of the point masses is given an upward velocity, though this can be changed
to any desirable initial condition.
